Drawings for an object to keep my door shut.

For this project I decided to print something that would help me keep my bedroom door closed when I am away from the house. I decided to create this because of my roommates dog constantly entering my room when I am gone. My drawing consists of two different pieces. The piece that wraps around the door knob is meant to be printed with soft PLA and the pieces that connect the two doors can be any regular PLA.
